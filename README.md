### The Todo Application ###

The todo application is a note taking application or how I put it, a daily task reminder. It helps you create notes or activities you intend working on or doing either today, tomorrow or the day after. Simplified and functional.

### How to Install and Run###
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open folder in preferred editor.
3. Open folder in terminal and install packages using the command "npm install"
4. After successfully installing dependencies, in the terminal, run the application using "npm run dev-server" to run code in development state or on you local machine or use "npm run build" to build code for deployment or production.
